Websockets is a bi-directional, full duplex computer communications protocol over a single TCP connection. It is a stateful protocol, which means it stores
data about the connection between the client and the server.

Some applications of websockets are:
1. Real-time web applications
2. Gaming/streaming applications 
3. Chat applications

This is a golang implementation of websockets where there are multiple clients.
